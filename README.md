Two sum question



Basically we use a dictionary/hash map 

run through array,check if complement(target-num) is already present in hash map.

if yes,return the indices of 2 elements that sum upto target.

else ,update hash map with current element and index (use enumerate).

time complexity : O(n)

space compllexity: O(n) may be for hash map.

The fact that search and update operations are O(1) in hash map /dictionary on average has helped to navigate through this problem easily
